<h2>Plundering Pirates</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>Using the arrow keys to control a pirate ship to plunder as much gold as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Enemy ships spawn a certain distance away from the pirate ship so that it does not spawn right on top of the pirate ship and give free gold</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>I learned how to spawn enemies a certain distance away from the player so that it does not spawn on top of the player.</li>
<li>The easiest part was spawning in the player and an enemy ship. The hardest part was figuring out how to make it so that the enemy ship did not spawn on top of the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Background from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/ocean-background">here</a></li>
<li>Ship assets from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/free-pirates-game-assets-by-unlucky-studio">here</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>Learned to destroy images from <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/sprites/destroy">here</a></li>
<li>Leanred how to create a custom boundary from <a href="http://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/physics/arcade/custom%20bounds.js">here</a></li>
<li>Leanred how to register keys for input from <a href="https://phaser.discourse.group/t/how-do-i-move-a-custom-sprite-with-arrow-keys/5967">here</a></li>
<li>Leanred how to turn disable input from keyboard from <a href="https://phaser.discourse.group/t/temporarry-disable-key-captures-in-game/4524">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Run into the other ships to plunder as much gold as you can within the time limit!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pirates
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Move with arrow keys. Enemy ships spawn randomly. Timed high-score game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Moving, overlapping, randomly spawning</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>I want them to feel excited enough to try and beat their previous score</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You are the pirate ship. You move with the arrow keys. Your goal is to run into as many enemy ships as you can to increase your gold count before the timer runs out. Once the timer ends, you get your final score.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No real strategies since the ships spawn randomly. You just have to hope they spawn really close.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is an abstract pirate game. This can be any pirate trying to plunder the seas for as much gold as they can steal.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any ages
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 minute
</li>
