<h2>No devil lived on</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Going backwards in time to work with your past self/selves (i was unaware that we were making playable games each week. thought we were making one game and iterating it. sorry for lack of actual gameplay)
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Creating other versions of the player that recreate the path they took, only backwards
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to add background/assets/sprites.
Hardest part was trying to figure out the proper syntax. Led to a few frustrating hours.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Obtained assets and code from <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part7">here</a>.
Button asset obtained from <a href="https://latenighcoffe.itch.io/buttons-blocks-for-ui-gameplay">here</a>.
Door asset obtained from <a href="https://zeroberto.itch.io/tile-setdungeon">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Obtained assets and code from <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part7">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use the turnstile to work with your past self/selves in order to solve puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Things must only be added as the game progresses, not removed.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
2D platformer puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For this prototype, using buttons to open doors
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Intrigue as they try to solve the puzzles
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
For this prototype, all you can do is move around with the arrow keys, use the character sprite onto a button to press it, and open a door when the button is pressed.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Creating various paths that are helpful in some way for your future self, such as standing on a button in forward time, and standing on a different button in reverse time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Not sure if I'll ever be able to implement a story, but essentially you, the player, are trying to defeat a bunch of devil bosses by using time to your advantage (hence the name "No devil lived on" p.s. its also a palandrome). The devils are trying to take over the world and its up the the player to stop them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Teens to adults
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As of now like 10 seconds.
</li>
