<h2>Mommy commeth</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Randomized trash thrown about the room. Limited time to clean up all trash. Both a win condition for picking up all the trash and a lose condition for not cleaning it all in time.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Custom cursor. Random trash spawns in specific area. Implements a win and lose condition. Also plays audio along with win and lose conditions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I leanred how to make a custom cursor, how to randomly spawn items in a specific area, and how to implement a win and lose condition. The easiest part was getting the assets loaded. The hardest part was figuring out the specific area to spawn items.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Background obtained from <a href="https://assage.itch.io/isometric-room">here</a></li>
<li>Feather duster for cursor from <a href="https://pixabay.com/vectors/duster-feather-clean-housework-2908292/">here</a></li>
<li>Crumpled paper ball from <a href="https://www.stickpng.com/img/miscellaneous/crumpled-paper/crumpled-paper-ball">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>Custom cursor code from <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/cursors/custom-cursor">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your mom is on her way home and you need to clean your room before you get into trouble!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Cleaning
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Timed clicker game. Random spawns of trash.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Implementing a win/lose condition.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A sense of urgency to clean up all of the trash so that they don't lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
There is 50 seconds to click on as much of the trash as possible. There are 160 pieces of trash randomly spawned in the room. If the player does not remove all of the trash on time, they lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Mashing the click button in order to quickly remove as much trash as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A little vague. You are meant to be a child/young adult living with parents, and you know that if you do not clean up your room before your mom gets home, you will get in trouble.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 50 seconds
</li>
